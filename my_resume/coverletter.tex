\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{About Me}
\quad I attended Penn State for Engineering Science with a minor in Engineering Mechanics, but was unable to finish my degree due to financial reasons. I then worked as an Electromechanical Engineer for two years designing hardware testing systems and vibration testing fixtures. During this time I found out that I enjoy programming and software development and decided that I would like to pursue a career in the industry. While I was employed I completed my degree requirements independently and decided to return to school for a second degree.

\quad My current plan is to graduate in Fall 2017 and begin a Master's program in Computer Science and Engineering with a focus on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence starting Fall 2018.

\lettersection{Why Company?}
\quad Because stuff.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
\quad I am eager \& willing to learn new skills and adapt to the requirements of a professional environment quickly. During my previous employment, I was initially hired as an Electrical Engineer despite having a limited background in the subject. I individually designed several hardware and software for test fixtures utilizing microprocessors to automate hardware testing as well as headed the design of a signal-routing chassis as part of a test station.

\quad Following this project, the company's Principal Mechanical Engineer hand picked me to aid in designing modular truss structures for rapid deployment on, vibration fixtures for rack-mounted servers, and the modeling of a light-weight, modular shipping container proposal.
